# ETL-Project

## EXTRACTION

The goal of this project is to compare trends in cryptocurrency values with popularity in media and frequency of hits in public forums. In order to do this, we will extract cryptocurrency data from Kaggle documenting daily highs, lows, and volumes traded, as well as scrape posts from the r/CryptoCurrency page on Reddit to analyze traction gained.


### r/CryptoCurrency

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/.json?f=flair_name%3A%22TRADING%22

- This data will be scraped from the Reddit website, and pulled into Jupyter Notebooks in .json formats to ultimately be cleaned up. 

### Kaggle criptocurrencies data

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/gorgia/criptocurrencies?select=bitcoin_usd_gwa.csv

- This data will be downloaded in CSV format before ultimately being loaded into the database.
